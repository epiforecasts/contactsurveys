## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version we have:

* Expanded the Description field and added a reference to the POLYMOD study
  with a doi link.
* Added `\value` tags to all exported function documentation.
* Replaced `\dontrun{}` with `\donttest{}` or conditional examples as
  appropriate.
* Changed writing functions to default to `tempdir()` instead of a
  user-writable directory.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release, split off from the existing CRAN package {socialmixr}.
